MODIStsp  <img src="man/figures/logo.png" width="147" height="170" align="right" />
=========
[MODIStsp](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/) is a "R" package devoted to
automatizing the creation of time series of rasters derived from MODIS Land Products
data.
MODIStsp allows to perform several preprocessing steps (e.g., download, mosaicing,
reprojection and resize) on MODIS data available within a given time period. 
Users have the ability to select which specific layers of the original MODIS HDF
files they want to process. They also can select which additional Quality Indicators 
should be extracted from the aggregated MODIS Quality Assurance layers and, in the 
case of Surface Reflectance products, which Spectral Indexes should be computed 
from the original reflectance bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as
single-band raster filescorresponding to each available acquisition date. 
Virtual files allowing access to the entire time series as a single file can be 
also created. All processing parameters can be easily selected with a user-friendly
GUI, although non-interactive execution exploiting a previously created Options 
File is possible. Stand-alone execution outside an "R" environment is also possible,
allowing to use scheduled execution of MODIStsp to automatically update time series 
related to a MODIS product and extent whenever a new image is available.

## <i class="fa fa-desktop" aria-hidden="true"></i> System Requirements 

`MODIStsp` requires [R](https://cran.r-project.org) v >= 3.2.1 and [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) 
(Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) v >= 1.11.1 __with support for HDF4 raster format__ 
to be installed in your system. Brief instructions for installing R and GDAL can be found [HERE](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/articles/installation.html#installing-r-and-gdal).

# Installation Instructions

## <i class="fa fa-windows" aria-hidden="true"></i> Installing on Windows

You can install the stable version of `MODIStsp` from CRAN: 

`install.packages("MODIStsp")`

, or the development version (containing the latest improvements and bug fixes) 
from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/MODIStsp")
```

Note that **if the `GTK+` library is not already installed on your system, 
installation may fail**. In that case, please install and load the `gWidgetsRGtk2`
library beforehand:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("gWidgetsRGtk2")
library(gWidgetsRGtk2)
```
    
Upon loading `gWidgetsRGtk2`, an error window will probably appear. This signals
that library "GTK+" is not yet installed on your system or is not on your PATH. 
To install it press "OK". A new window dialog window will appear, asking if you.
want to install "GTK+". Select "Install GTK" and then "OK" . Windows will download
and install the GTK+ library. When it finishes, the RSession should be restarted
and you should be ready to go !
 
 In case RStudio does not automatically restart or continuously asks to install 
 GTK+ again, kill it form "Task Manager" (or restart the R session from RStudio
 "Session" menu), reload RStudio and the try to reload `gWidgetsRGtk2`. If it loads
 correctly, you should be ready to go. 

If it still fails, try downloading the GTK+ bundle from:

<http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip> 
(OR <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101227_win32.zip> if on Win32)

, unzip the archive on a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\GTK+`),
then add the path to its "bin" subfolder (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\GTK+\\bin\\` 
to your system PATH environment variable.

Restart your system and try loading again `gWidgetsRGtk2`: if it loads ok, you 
should be ready to install `MODIStsp`

## <i class="fa fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i> Installing on Linux Systems

To install `MODIStsp` on Linux, you have to first install the following required
dependencies: 

  * `Cairo` >= 1.0.0, `ATK` >= 1.10.0, `Pango` >= 1.10.0, `GTK+` >= 2.8.0, `GLib` >= 2.8.0 (required by package ```RGtk2```)
  * `Curl` (required by package ```curl```)
  * `GDAL` >= 1.6.3, `PROJ.4` >= 4.4.9 (required by package ```rgdal```)
    
On *Debian and Ubuntu-based* systems, to install those packages open a terminal
and type: 
    
```bash
sudo apt-get install r-cran-cairodevice r-cran-rgtk2 libcairo2-dev libatk1.0-dev libpango1.0-dev 
libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev
```
    
On *rpm-base systems*, to install packages open a terminal and type:  

```bash
sudo yum install libcairo2-devel libatk1.0-devel libpango1.0-devel gtk2 gtk2-devel 
glib2-devel libcurl-devel gdal-devel proj proj-devel proj-epsg proj-nad
```
    
Then, you can install the stable version of MODIStsp from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("MODIStsp")
```
, or the development version (containing the latest improvements and bug fixes) 
from github;

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/MODIStsp")
```

## <i class="fa fa-apple" aria-hidden="true"></i> Installing on Mac

**NOTE**: The following  installation notes should be valid for MODIStsp installation 
on R 3.4.0 and above with Mac OSX Sierra. They were mainly taken (i.e., blatantly
copied...) from: https://zhiyzuo.github.io/installation-rattle/. Thanks to Zhiya 
Zuo for providing this!

To properly install `MODIStsp` you will need to first install package `RGTk2`. This
is a somehow difficult operation. The following instructions should help:
<br>

__1. Check your Mac OS X version and update if necessary: __

Enter the following command in terminal to check your macOS version. Expected
output is as below the dashed line ---.
    
```
~$ sw_vers  
------------------------  
ProductName:	Mac OS X  
ProductVersion:	10.12.6  
BuildVersion:	16G29  
```

If your system is above 10.11, continue. Otherwise, upgrade it to Sierra.

Install homebrew if you do not have it already installed. homebrew  is a very
convenient package manager for macOS. To do so, open a terminal, copy the following
command in it and hit Enter:

```bash
~$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Follow the instructions to get brew ready. When inserting your password, nothing 
will show up for security reasons. Just hit Enter when you are finished.

When brew is finished, copy the following command in terminal and hit Enter:

```bash
~$ touch ~/.bash_profile
~$ echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/gtk+-2.0.pc:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig" >> ~/.bash_profile
~$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
<br>

__2. Install the `cairo` library with x11 support__. Enter the following into your terminal:
 
```bash
~$ brew uninstall --force cairo --ignore-dependencies
~$ brew cask install xquartz
~$ brew install --with-x11 cairo
```
<br>
 
__3. Install the `gtk+` library__:
 
To do so, you first have to change the way homebrew wants to install gtk+. In an editor, write: 
 
```bash
~$ brew edit gtk+
```
 
A text editor will open. Look in the file, and find a section that begins with
"def install". Substitute the current `args` section with the following text: 
 
```bash
def install
 args = [
         "--disable-dependency-tracking",
         "--disable-silent-rules",
         "--prefix=#{prefix}",
         "--disable-glibtest",
         "--enable-introspection=yes",
         # "--disable-visibility",
         # "--with-gdktarget=quartz",
         "--with-gdktarget=x11",
         "--enable-x11-backend"
        ]
```     
 
Save the modified file using `ctrl+x ctrl+c`, followed by `y` to quit emacs.
Now install the library using: 
 
```bash
~$ brew install --build-from-source --verbose gtk+
```
<br>

__4. Update your path__ so that `gtk+` is recognized, using:

```bash
~$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/gtk+-2.0.pc:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
```
<br>

__5. Install `RGtk2` from source__:

- __Download the newest source file for RGtk2__ from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gWidgetsRGtk2.

- Assuming that the path to this file is ~/Downloads. Run the following in terminal 
(change the path if you did not download in ~/Downloads):

```bash
~$ cd ~/Downloads
~/Downloads$ R CMD INSTALL RGtk2_2.20.33.tar.gz
```
(Note that the name of the tar.gz file may vary depending on when you downloaded
the file). 

__6. Open R and run__: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(RGtk2)
```
hopefully, `RGtk2` will load without errors! If so, you should be ready to go, 
and you can:

__7. Install MODIStsp__ from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("MODIStsp")
MODIStsp()
```
or the development version from GitHub:
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools) 
install_github("ropensci/MODIStsp", ref = "master")
MODIStsp()
```
Good luck!


# Usage

The easiest way to use `MODIStsp` is to use its powerful GUI (Graphical User Interface)
for selection of processing options, and then run the processing. 

To open the GUI, load the package and launch the MODIStsp function, with no parameters:
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, caption=FALSE}
library(MODIStsp)
MODIStsp()
```
This **opens a GUI** from which processing options can be specified (and eventually 
saved or loaded). After specifying all required parameters, clicking on "Start" 
will start
the processing (see [HERE](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/articles/interactive_execution.html) 
for more detailed instructions).

`MODIStsp` can also be launched in non-interactive mode within an `R` session or
script by setting the optional `GUI` parameter to FALSE, and the `options_file`
parameter to the path of a previously saved JSON Options file. This allows to 
exploit `MODIStsp` functionalities within generic "R" processing scripts.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(MODIStsp) 
# --> Specify the path to a valid options file saved in advance from MODIStsp GUI 
options_file <- "X:/yourpath/youroptions.json" 
  
# --> Launch the processing
MODIStsp(gui = FALSE, options_file = options_file)
```
(see [HERE](http://ropensci.github.io/MODIStsp/articles/noninteractive_execution.html) 
for more detailed instructions and examples).
