Unfortunately the owner can no longer provide assistance for this package.
If you need to ask for help or make a question about {MODIStsp} functionalities,
refer to the package documentation first, 
and check if the topic was already addressed within closed issues.
Then, address remaining doubts to public forums like StackOverflow,
where other users could eventually provide useful ticks.
Any opened issues will be automatically closed, as well as reopened old issues 
will be ignored.
The following template instructions are kept for backwards compatibility.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the following template must not be deleted, but read and filled with the required information. Issues written without following the template will be marked as "malformed" and ignored.

Use this template if you need assistance running {MODIStsp} on your code (e.g., in case of errors which are not a bug / you are not sure if they are a bug), or if in doubt about which template you should use. Please use this method instead than sending private email to the authors.

Before opening a new issue please check if the problem was already been mentioned (if so but the found issue is closed, open a new issue citing the old task instead than reopening it).

Ensure that your {MODIStsp} version is update with the last CRAN version:
install.packages("MODIStsp")

Please take particular care with code reproducibility (follow indications provided in the template).

Due to the limited time available to address all the issues, the developer will preferentially address requests finalised to publish scientific works; in this case, please provide the required information in the template below.
