`{MODIStsp}` can be also executed as a "stand-alone" application (i.e., without having 
to open R/RStudio). 

To be able to do that, from R launch the function `install_MODIStsp_launcher()`.

- In a Linux operating system this function creates a desktop entry (accessible from 
the menu in the sections "Science" and "Geography") and a symbolic link in a known path
(default: `/usr/bin/MODIStsp`).
- In Windows, a link in the Start Menu and optionally a desktop shortcut are created.
See `?install_MODIStsp_launcher` for details and path customization.

Double-clicking these files or launching them from a shell without parameters will
launch `MODIStsp()` in interactive mode, by opening the GUI. Non-interactive mode 
can be triggered by adding the "-g"  argument to the call, and specifying the path
to a valid Options File as `-s` argument:

  - Linux: `MODIStsp -g -s "/yourpath/youroptions.json"`
  (see `MODIStsp -h` for details).
  
  - Windows:`your_r_library\MODIStsp\ExtData\Launcher\MODIStsp.bat -g -s "yourpath/youroptions.json"`
  (see `C:\Users\you\Desktop\MODIStsp -h` for details).

If you do not want to install any link, launchers can be found in the subdirectory
`MODIStsp/ExtData/Launcher` of your library path.

Stand-alone non-interactive execution can be exploited to periodically and automatically
update the time series of a selected product over a given study area. To do that, you
should simply follow these steps.

1.	Open the `MODIStsp()` GUI, define the parameters of the processing specifying a 
date in the future as the "Ending Date" and save the processing options; then quit
the program.
 
2. schedule non-interactive execution of the `{MODIStsp}` launcher script installed 
as seen before (or located in the subdirectory `MODIStsp/ExtData/Launcher` of your
`R` library path) as a windows scheduled task or linux "cron" job according to a 
specified time schedule, specifying the path of a previously saved Options file
as additional argument.

## _On Linux_

3. Edit your crontab by opening a terminal and typing:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
 
4. Add an entry for execution of MODIStsp launcher. For example, if you have 
installed it in /usr/bin and you want to run the tool every day at 23.00, add the
following row:
        
    ```bash
      0 23 * * * /bin/bash /usr/bin/MODIStsp -g -s "/yourpath/youroptions.json"
    ```
      
## _On Windows_

3. Create a Task following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc748993(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN" target="_blank">this instructions</a>.

4. Add the path of the MODIStsp.bat launcher as Action (point 6), 
specifying  `-g -s "X:/yourpath/youroptions.json"` as argument.
